  <h2>Selected Projects</h2>

  <div class="project">
    <strong>Market Risk Risk: Delta-Neutral Equity Options Portfolio</strong>
    <p>Built a delta-neutral equity options portfolio using listed vanilla and OTC structured contracts across multiple maturities.
Simulated profit and loss with Monte Carlo methods under the Heston model. Computed value-at-risk, market
sensitivities, and volatility sensitivities. Evaluated risk using hard limits and stress scenarios.

  <div class="project">
    <strong> Valuation of Down-and-out Put Option</strong>
    <p>
   This project aims to derive reasonable no-arbitrage prices for a set of simple derivatives written
on an asset exhibiting "non-standard" dynamics. In Section 1, the report focuses on the theoretical
analysis of a given stochastic differential equation (SDE) and the empirical assessment of the
underlying time series characteristics, primarily by evaluating Gaussian behavior. Subsequently,
the optimal set of parameters fitting the empirical data is obtained through maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE), utilizing the Euler discretization scheme of the SDE. Sections 2 and 3 are dedicated
to deriving inception no-arbitrage prices for three different types of derivative contracts based
on the underlying asset: a European put option (priced using three numerical approaches: Monte
Carlo simulation, lattice discretization, and a PDE scheme), the American version of the European
put option, and a Down-and-Out barrier variant of the same put option.

    <strong> Impact of valution adjustments on option prices</strong>
    <p>
   Developed a simulation-based model to measure counterparty credit, funding, and capital impacts on pricing a
down-and-in put option. Simulated interest rates using a calibrated Hull–White short-rate model and equity prices under
geometric Brownian motion, with sotchastic rates. Generated exposure profiles through pathwise revaluation of the swap
and option, showing a negative impact of valuation adjustments on the option’s value.

    <strong>Structuring: built-to-suit data center</strong>
    <p>
      Built-to-suit data center investment involving a data services company and a sponsor bearing construction, credit, and
refinancing risk. Hedged the sponsor’s risk by modeling period-by-period project cash flows and debt service mechanics.
Structured a senior debt mini-perm with fixed-price construction risk transfer. Priced an interest rate swap and
incorporated the valuation adjustments. Evaluated leverage and debt service coverage ratios, stress-tested key drivers, and
demonstrated resilience and refinancing viability post-construction.

  <div class="project">
    <strong>Bachelor Thesis: Volatility Forecasting</strong>
    <p>
      Assessed the performance of different model classes for forecasting weekly realised volatility of the Financial Times Stock Exchange One Hundred index using daily price data from Refinitiv Workspace over the period from 2004 to 2024. Selected realised volatility as an observable and model-independent measure rather than option-implied volatility. Aligned realised and conditional volatility measures to allow a consistent comparison across modelling approaches. Found that simple autoregressive models provided the most accurate forecasts overall, while neural-network-based methods achieved lower forecasting errors than models based on conditional variance alone, with additional improvements when the two approaches were combined.
